In this repository you can find the style and interaction guidelines for Make

## Licensing

Copyright 2019 Make or Break.

The files available here are to be used only as a reference to implement the
Make or Break website.

We are new to licensing non-software works. For now, we are not using any free
/ open source / creative commons license. We are trying to figure out the
current best practices when it comes to licensing graphic design works.


## Transparency

We commissioned [Hapibot Studio](https://www.hapibot.com/) to do the initial
work on the landing page and brand guidelines.
